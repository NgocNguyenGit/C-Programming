Part 2


Create these functions:

1. Calculates the sum of 2 integers and prints out the result.

2. Returns the sum of 2 integers.

3. Returns the average of 2 integers

4. Returns the average of 4 floating point values.

6. Returns the factorial.

7. Returns the biggest of 2 integers.

8. Returns the biggest of 3 integers.

10. Converts inches to centimeters.

11. Returns the BMI.

12. Function returns the biggest of 5 integers.

15. Program with functions calculates amount of combinations.

16. Function prints out a lotto row.

17. Program with functions calculates the standard deviation.

18. Functions calculate:
- sum of an array
- min and max

19. Function searches for a value from an array.

20. Returns the sum of an array.

21. Function multiplies every value in an array by 2.

22.
A character is passed to a function: funtion returns True if character is 
a vowel, otherwise False (0). 
(Five of the 26 alphabet letters are vowels: A, E, I, O, and U. )

23.
A whole number and an array (size is 5, contains integers) are passed to 
a function that checks how many times passed value exists in that passed array 
and returns the amount.

24.
Your program defines and fills an array of 10 integers with random numbers that are between 1-5.
That array is passed to a method that counts the amounts of different values and prints then out.

25.
Duration and frequency are passed to a function that plays then that sound (windows.h neeeded).

=================================================================
Functions that handle strings are to be done later

Function converts the text to morse code characters.

Function checks if the post code includes exactly 5 numbers.
